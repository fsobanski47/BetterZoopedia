# Better Zoopedia

Better Zoopedia is an enhanced and extended version of the Planet Zoo encyclopedia designed to provide comprehensive, structured, and easily accessible information about animals featured in the game.

## Future Plans

- Add complete data sets to the database to include all animals featured in the game, ensuring full coverage and accuracy.
- Develop a web application that will provide an intuitive and visually appealing interface to explore animal data, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- Create a tool for designing interspecies habitats, detailing all necessary conditions, space requirements, and compatibility to ensure optimal environments for multiple species coexisting.
- Develop an extensive trivia database for each animal, highlighting community contributions, popular mods, and the general perception and cultural significance of each species within the Planet Zoo community, as well as general information about each animal outside of the game's universe.

Made with ❤️ to enhance the Planet Zoo experience!
